I am an undergraduate student at the Ocean University of China (OUC), where I am pursuing broad training in computer science and artificial intelligence. My research interests lie primarily in AI safety, natural language processing (NLP) applications, and multimodal understanding, with a particular focus on building reliable and robust AI systems.

In the summer of 2025, I had the privilege of working with Prof. Wei Dong at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) as a visiting research student, where I conducted research related to AI safety. This experience strengthened my interest in foundational AI research and exposed me to international academic collaboration.

I am actively preparing to apply for PhD programs in Fall 2027 and am also seeking research internship opportunities for Summer 2026. My long-term goal is to pursue a research-oriented career in artificial intelligence, contributing to the development of safe, trustworthy, and human-aligned AI systems.
